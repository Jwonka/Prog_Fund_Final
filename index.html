          <p><strong><em>Write a program that uses a loop. Inside the loop, the program asks a 
               user what their GPA is.  If their GPA is over 3.0 it then asks how

               ask the user if they want to play again.  If the user does not

VARIABLES: conditionalMessage, playMessage, userInput

TEST CASE 1:

  INPUT VALUES: GPA 2.0, 

  EXPECTED RESULT: Your GPA is: 2.0 
  
                   You should study!

  ACTUAL RESULT: Your GPA is: 2

                 You should study!

TEST CASE 2:

  INPUT VALUES: GPA 3.1, money available 200

  EXPECTED RESULT: Your GPA is: 3.1 
                
                   You have $200 available. 
                   
                   You should go to work! 

  ACTUAL RESULT: Your GPA is: 3.1
  
                 You have $200 available. 
                   
                 You should go to work!

TEST CASE 3:

  INPUT VALUES: GPA 3.8, money available 800

  EXPECTED RESULT:  Your GPA is: 3.8 
  
                    You have $800 available.
                    
                    Do you want to watch Netlix?

  ACTUAL RESULT:  Your GPA is: 3.8

                  You have $800 available.

                  Do you want to watch Netflix?

TEST CASE 4:

  INPUT VALUES:  GPA fv, money available 0

  EXPECTED RESULT:  Your GPA is: NaN

                    You have $0 available.

                    You should go to work!
