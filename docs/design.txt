PROBLEM STATEMENT: Write a program that uses a loop. Inside the loop, the program asks a 
                   user what their GPA is.  If their GPA is over 3.0 it then asks how 
                   much money they have available. When the loop has completed, 
                   ask the user if they want to play again.  If the user does not 
                   want to play again display input and decision to the user.


Nouns: input, loop completed, money available, decision  

Verbs: asks, loop, display

INPUTS: conditionalMessage

        playMessage
        userInput
        

PROCESSING: Initialize conditionalMessage to ""
            Initialize moneyMessage to ""
            Initialize playMessage to "y"
            Initialize userInput to ""
            
            Prompt for userInput with "What is your current GPA?" 
            Convert userInput to a number
            If UserInput less than or equal to "3"
            Create conditionalMessage
            Display conditionalMessage with "Your GPA is: " + userInput + "You should study!"
            Prompt for moneyMessage with "How much money do you have available?" 
            Convert moneyMessage to a number
            If moneyMessage is greater than 500
            Create conditionalMessage
            Display conditionalMessage with "Do you want to watch Netflix?"
            Else create conditionalMessage
            Display conditionalMessage with "Do you want to watch Netflix?"
